# Catecophony

Catecophony is a VST3/AU plugin that performs real-time corpus-based concatenative synthesis. Given some source audio (the _corpus_) which is split into thousands of grains and analysed, it attempts to recreate an incoming audio stream (the _target_) using the corpus grains. The result is pointillist sound shapes that are often chaotic and sometimes lovely.
